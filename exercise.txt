# Payment Form

Recreate `payment-form.png` using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## About the comp

* The font used is Open Sans.
* The "Name" field is currently in focus, and the line there is the cursor.
  Do not recreate the cursor!
* When the user clicks "Edit", they can edit the value ($500). You can implement
  this however you want. When they are done editing, the form should look like
  the comp again, but with all instances of $500 updated to the new value.
* Hovering over the question marks (?) reveals explanatory tooltips for those
  fields. Choose brief, clear messages for these. Using HTML `title` is
  sufficient, but you can use third-party libraries to implement fancy tooltips
  if you wish.
* The comp doesn't show validation error messages, but we would like to warn the
  user when they've left a field blank. Where would you put these validation
  message(s)? When should they appear? Use JS to show validation messages
  when/where required. Do *not* worry about validating non-empty fields (e.g.
  checking whether they've entered only numbers in the "Card number" field).

## Directions

* You may use CSS preprocessors like LESS or SASS.
* You may use icon fonts (like Font Awesome) or images of your choice for
  the icons.
* You may use third-party libraries like jQuery to handle interactivity.
* Do *not* use third-party UI libraries like Bootstrap for styling/structure.

## What we are looking for

* Clean, well-structured code
* Visually resembles the comp
* Accessible
* Good usability
* Styling accounts for corner cases (e.g. what if the form was localized and
  the form field labels were longer than one line?)

## Submission

Submit all of the resources used in your design (HTML, CSS, images, fonts, JS,
etc). If you used a CSS preprocessor, include those source files as well.
